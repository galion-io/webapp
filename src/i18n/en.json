      "TEXT": "How do we keep your keys safe ?\n\nWhen you choose a password for your Galion Wallet, we first hash the password you choose by using Bcrypt in your browser, so your password is never sent to our servers. Then, we hash this value with PBKDF2 algorithm to store it on our servers. This allows us to detect if your enter the wrong password, without actually knowing your password.\nDuring this process, a unique salt is generated for each user and your private keys are encrypted using AES256 with a combination of this unique salt and your password. When you want to sign a transaction, we receive your password and compute if it matches the hashes we have stored. This process takes about a second because these algorithms are specifically designed to be slow (to prevent brute force attacks). If the password's hash matches, we use it to decrypt your private key, and sign a transaction. Your password is then deleted from memory.\n\nIn the worst case scenario where a malicious hacker would gain access to our database, they won't be able to sign transactions without your Galion Wallet password, because the times to bruteforce your password are prohibitively long.\n\nFor other accounts that require a private API key but for which we still need to be able to automatically poll data, like exchanges, all encryptions are made with 2 keys : one in the (compiled) source code, and one that is stored on the production servers only. So even our developers that can access the source code and database can't decrypt your API private keys. Only a small set of trusted people can access the production servers.\nAPI keys that allow write access will be stored with the same security level as your Galion wallet's private keys (we will have to ask you for a password every time we want to decrypt it).\n\nAccess to our production environments are restricted to a small set of IP addresses and access to 3rd party administration interfaces (like our web host) are protected by 2FA."

They are sourced on their respective platforms' APIs, using the credentials you provided us. Ethereum accounts are refreshed more often, every 30 minutes. This includes ERC20 tokens.\n\nOperations are refreshed the same way as Balances, except they are on a different refresh cycle because they are costly to fetch. Today they are also refreshed every 4 hours but we may change Balance and Operation's polling periodicity separately in the future. All account types may soon be refreshed on different periodicities in order to refresh services with good APIs more often.\n\nAlso, if you are trading through the Galion interface, all Ethereum account's data is refreshed in near real-time so you can follow what's happening."
