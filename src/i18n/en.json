They are sourced on their respective platforms' APIs, using the credentials you provided us. Ethereum accounts are refreshed more often, every 30 minutes. This includes ERC20 tokens.\n\nOperations are refreshed the same way as Balances, except they are on a different refresh cycle because they are costly to fetch. Today they are also refreshed every 4 hours but we may change Balance and Operation's polling periodicity separately in the future. All account types may soon be refreshed on different periodicities in order to refresh services with good APIs more often.\n\nAlso, if you are trading through the Galion interface, all Ethereum account's data is refreshed in near real-time so you can follow what's happening."
